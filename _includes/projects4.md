#### Post-Doc
---------------

* I did a short **Postdoc** to integrate my models into the commercially available ADF/Band quantum-chemistry [code](https://www.scm.com/doc/BAND/Input/NEGF.html). I worked on this with van Gisbergen and Philipse at SCM, a spinoff of the Theoretical Chemistry group at the Free University (VU) in Amsterdam.


    
#### Doctorate
-----------------
* My **Ph.D.** [research](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:5a6b8240-1033-4834-b947-09c54b0f891b?collection=research) was on better models for electronic transport in single-molecule nanostructures, to understand molecular-electronics experiments at the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience in Delft. Work was on quantum transport and quantum chemistry, but also involved HPC parallel algorithm design (run on the Huygens supercomputer @[SARA](https://www.surf.nl/en/about-surf/subsidiaries/surfsara)), and we

  - developed a code for single-molecule transport modeling, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3860), [JPhysChemC](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp3044225)
  - explained some neat experiments, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4266), [NatureNano](https://www.nature.com/articles/nnano.2013.26)
  - and  extended the theory a bit, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06413), [JChemPhys](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4934882)
  - while establishing the feasibility of way cheaper methods you should probably use first. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3861), [JChemPhys](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4793259)
  - used for some neat thermo-electricity calculations as well, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00179), [JChemPhys](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4913290)



#### Master's
---------------

* My **M.Sc.** [research](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:922fcd8d-bd5a-446a-ad27-6827e3aeba1d/?collection=research) developed numerical algorithms aware of the dynamical structure in the equations governing satellite orbits, in order to provide more accurate simulation of trajectories from:
    
  - an astrodynamics angle: Numerically-conservative integration in N-body problems
  - an applied math angle: Approximations to 1st Integrals in N-body problems
  - code [github]
