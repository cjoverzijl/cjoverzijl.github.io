<!--                    <p>Scientific, financial and engineering expertise, effectively communicated.<br> Interested in solving challenging problems that cross disciplines and borders.</p>
-->
                    <p> Physicist, risk quant, and just a guy from the islands. 

<p>I do quantitative modeling of markets and investments, the design and implementation of predictive analytics systems, and occasional model validation. In larger projects I typically run a small team of specialists as technical lead. 

<p> Passionate about solid research and its use in risk-aware investment strategy, I am particularly interested in understanding network structure as a causal factor in the dynamics of financial markets. Understanding and visualizing this structure is usually underestimated in managing market, credit and liquidity risk. Broadly speaking, I apply this line of thinking to trading and asset management.

<br><br>

Otherwise open to any interesting problem, always looking for new insights, and novel takes on the world. I'm also fascinated by languages in the broad sense, and speak:
                    <li> English and Dutch natively, </li>
                    <li> French and a little Spanish and Portuguese conversationally.</p>
