                    <h2>About Me</h2>
<!--                    <p>Scientific, financial and engineering expertise, effectively communicated.<br> Interested in solving challenging problems that cross disciplines and borders.</p>
-->
                    <p> Physicist, risk quant, and just a guy from the islands. 
<p>I do quantitative modeling, the design and implementation of predictive analytics systems, and occasional model validation. In larger projects I typically run a small team of specialists as technical lead. Passionate about solid research and its use in risk-aware investment strategy.
<p>Deeply interested in understanding network structure as a causal factor in the dynamics of financial markets. I believe understanding and visualizing this structure is necessary to manage market, credit and liquidity risk. Broadly speaking, I want to apply this to the defensive side of trading and asset management. 
                    <br><br>
                    Otherwise open to pretty much any interesting problem, always looking for new insights, and novel takes on the world.</p>
