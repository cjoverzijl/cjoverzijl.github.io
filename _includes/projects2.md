---------------

* #### An Investment Game (2017)
  > Derived from a real event run for charity during the 2014 World Cup on the basis of the models introduced here, this presents a novel investment game, taking a quantitative finance approach to football tournaments. Published in Wilmott.
  > Matlab, SAS.

    
* #### Ebola Outbreak Spread Models (2016)
  > Derived from work at a summerschool at the Santa Fe Institute, developed models describing the essential dynamics of the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. We focused on understanding the qualitative dynamics of SIR-class models, and how deviations correlated spatially and temporally with observed real-world features like border closures, geospatial migration networks, and genetic variation. Published in Nature Scientific Reports.
  > Python (pandas, networkx and geomapping).


* #### Convergence in the Sciences (2015)
  > Based out of the Santa Fe Institute, developed an analysis of temporal trends in research, and distance-measures to quantify distance between clusters of research topics using only primary texts and LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) based topic modeling. Published in Pensamiento.
  > Python, Matlab, Mallet & NLTK.
