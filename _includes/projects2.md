## Recent Academic Work

* #### An Investment Game (2017)
  Derived from a real event run for charity during the 2014 World Cup on the basis of the models introduced here, this presents a novel investment game, taking a quantitative finance approach to football tournaments. Published in Wilmott.
  - Matlab, SAS

    
* #### Ebola Outbreak Spread Models (2016)
  Derived from work at a summerschool at the Santa Fe Institute, developed models describing the essential dynamics of the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. We focused on understanding the qualitative dynamics of SIR-class models, and how deviations correlated spatially and temporally with observed real-world features like border closures, geospatial migration networks, and genetic variation. Published in Nature Scientific Reports.
  - Python (pandas, networkx and geomapping)


* #### Convergence in the Sciences (2015)
  Based out of the Santa Fe Institute, developed an analysis of temporal trends in research, and distance-measures to quantify distance between clusters of research topics using only primary texts and LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) based topic modeling. Published in Pensamiento.
  - Python, Matlab, Mallet & NLTK


### Post-Doc

* My code was integrated into the commercially available ADF / Band quantum-chemistry code, which I worked on with van Gisbergen and Philipse at SCM, a spinoff of the Theoretical Chemistry group at the VU in Amsterdam.

### Doctorate

* My PhD research was on better models for electronic transport in single-molecule nanostructures, to understand molecular-electronics experiments at the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience in Delft. Work was on quantum transport and quantum chemistry, but also involved HPC parallel algorithm design (run on the Huygens supercomputer @SARA), and we

  - developed a code for single-molecule transport modeling, [arxiv, journal]
  - explained some neat experiments, [arxiv, journal]
  - and  extended the theory a bit
  - while establishing the feasibility of way cheaper methods you should probably use first. [arxiv, journal]
  - used for ...


### Master's

* My MSc research developed numerical algorithms aware of the dynamical structure in the equations governing satellite orbits, in order to provide more accurate simulation of trajectories from:
    
  - an astrodynamics angle: Numerically-conservative integration in N-body problems [TU repo]
  - an applied math angle: Approximations to 1st Integrals in N-body problems [TU repo]
  - code [github]
