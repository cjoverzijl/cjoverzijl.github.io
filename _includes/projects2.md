<!-- ## Applied Projects -->

### Applied Research & Data Science :: Older
---------------
* #### Analytics Platforms (2013-2016)
	
	* **"Analytical Environment"  Product Owner (team of 10):** Architecture and modeling for a core system for regulatory-compliance across firmwide product-offering to retail and private clients; dual-purposed as environment to enable the business to extract value through data science & analytics; SAS-based.
	* **"Pandora" Analytics Team-Lead (team of 4):** Developed a full investment performance and risk analytics system, with the goals of speedy, daily reporting and data provision to portfolio management teams. SAS development integrated with Factset, the FIS APT risk-engine, in-house datafeeds on a historicized DataVault design.
	* **SAS MI Team-Lead (team of 5):** Developed an analytics & reporting (BI/MI) platform for client holdings and asset flows over time. Architecture, ETL, DataVault approach to DWH, custom reporting engine, end-to-end flows, performance testing. SAS development, integrated with custom reporting engine.
	* **Enhanced Reporting Framework Team-Lead (team of 2):** Developed a unified framework for efficient, clean and modern reporting elements and style, designed for modular integration with data-warehousing and quantitative analytics solutions; SAS development.

* #### NLP on the ABN AMRO prospectus (2015)
    > Combining techniques from probabilistic topic modeling (using LDA) with simple visualization techniques to identify clusters of topics discussed in the prospectus of my employer when they IPO'd back in late 2015. This refurbished some of the code from the [Pensamiento](http://revistas.upcomillas.es/index.php/pensamiento/article/view/6590) paper, but the neat results are just the visuals: summarizing an entire prospectus' key topics in a [one-word-summary](img/Topics1.png), and [by topic](img/Topics3a.png). For more details, check out the Python at [github]

* #### LPPL Financial Crashes (2014)
	> Implemented a predictive model of financial crashes driven by herding behavior, which is expressed through log-periodic power-law oscillations. Based on the research of [Didier Sornette](http://www.er.ethz.ch/), [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=190544). A nice visualization to understand these somewhat unstable models (implemented naively) is to ask the question "how do we know the prediction is stable", as encouragingly indicated by the plateau at about t=+50 days (y-axis, forward in time) from t=0 (x-axis, backward in time) in this [figure](img/Stability Plateau.png). Older example code on [github](https://github.com/cjoverzijl/lppl-model-r), unfortunately broken by the now-defunct yahoo-finance interface.
	

* #### "Investment Game" for Charity (2014)
    > Developed the models for, and major parts of a full **transaction-processing**, analytics and reporting stack for an "Investment Game" organized for the benefit of the Children's Khazana Foundation, running live during the 2014 World Cup, as a complete and investable securities market; a [preprint](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3273905) describing the modeling is on SSRN. Matlab models, SAS implementation in production.

* #### Exchange Matching Engine (2011)
	> QuantCup 2011 competition entry, implementing an exchange matching algorithm.
	Ugly C++ code on [github](https://github.com/cjoverzijl/quantcup-2011).

* #### NEGF in ADF/BAND (2008-2012)
	> Developed a scalable, high-performance, quantum-chemical NEGF transport code (Physics PhD), which was later integrated into a commercial quantum-chemistry modeling solution.
    Developed a scalable, high-performance, quantum-chemical NEGF transport code, which was later integrated into a commercial quantum-chemistry modeling solution ([SCM's ADF/Band package](http://www.scm.com)).
	Fortran multicore supercomputer-ready code, Python postprocessing.


* #### GSM-R for NCBG (2010)
    > Designed a statistical methodology for validation of GSM-R networks during field-trials on the high-speed railway networks in the Netherlands and Belgium, later used in the design of a network in Tunisia. Developed software for transmission interference analysis and cell-tower lookups
    ([consulting as Radio Network Planner for ClearCinCom](http://www.clearcincom.com)).
	Perl and VB development.
