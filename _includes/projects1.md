### Applied Research & Data Science :: Recent
---------------

* #### Holmes (2014 â€“ )
	> Work on a novel general inference engine (i.e. an AI in the full-blown AGI sense) which recognizes patterns in (multiple) sensory data (streams) over time. The engine predicts and influences its environment to increase the likelihood of the occurrence of the goals driving its motivation. 
    Design leverages Cassandra on GCP, Python and SQL; with a guy called [Molanus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-molanus-37832b10/).


* ####	Active Bet-Sizing (2018)
	> Designing a custom approach to combining (fundamental) conviction with (systematic) risk-balanced portfolio-construction in a hybrid fundamental/quant approach. Tailored models, implementation tools and visualization delivered with
Matlab & Python.


* ####	Quant Equity Alpha Models (2017-2018)
	> Tying together stock-level and aggregated (e.g. sector or region) quantitative signals for bottom-up and top-down market views, to an optimization- and backtesting-framework for studying portfolio construction decisions. Bridges the Kelly-perspective and cross-sectional regression approaches. Matlab development integrated with multiple production datafeeds.
