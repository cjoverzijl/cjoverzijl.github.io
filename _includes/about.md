<!-- ## ABOUT -->

####Strategist, physicist, and just a guy from the islands####

I currently do **cross-asset strategy**, based on quantitative modeling of financial markets. I've concurrently run **global equity portfolios**, and before that did design and implementation of **predictive-analytics** systems for investment management, and occasional (market-risk and alpha-) **model validation**. In larger projects I've typically run a small team of specialists as **technical lead**.

My background is in physics and math: I'm passionate about the role of solid, no-BS research in risk-aware investment strategy. I want to understand the network-structure behind the dynamics of financial markets, which is underestimated in managing market, credit and liquidity risk, imho. Beyond that I'm always open to interesting cross-disciplinary research, always looking for new insights and novel takes on the world. This single page is essentially my project portfolio, as it were.

I hail from a tiny island called St. Martin in the Caribbean, and love languages in the broad sense. 
I speak:

- English and Dutch natively,
- French and some Spanish and Portuguese,
- and of course math & code ...
