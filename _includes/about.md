**Physicist, investment quant, and just a guy from the islands.**

I currently do equity investment, based on the quantitative modeling of markets and strategies. I am also experienced with the design and implementation of predictive-analytics systems, and occasional model validation. In larger projects I typically run a small team of specialists as technical lead.

Broadly speaking, I apply this line of thought to risk-aware asset management. 

Otherwise open to any interesting problem, always looking for new insights, and novel takes on the world. I'm also fascinated by languages in the broad sense, and speak:

- French and a little Spanish and Portuguese conversationally,
- and math & code ...
