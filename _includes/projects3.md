### Post-Doc
---------------
* I did a short **Postdoc** to integrate my models into the commercially available ADF/Band quantum-chemistry [code](https://www.scm.com/doc/BAND/Input/NEGF.html). I worked on this with van Gisbergen and Philipse at SCM, a spinoff of the Theoretical Chemistry group at the Free University (VU) in Amsterdam. 
    
### Doctorate
---------------
* My **PhD** research was on better models for electronic transport in single-molecule nanostructures, to understand molecular-electronics experiments at the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience in Delft. Work was on quantum transport and quantum chemistry, but also involved HPC parallel algorithm design (run on the Huygens supercomputer @SARA), and we

  - developed a code for single-molecule transport modeling, [arxiv, journal]
  - explained some neat experiments, [arxiv, journal]
  - and  extended the theory a bit
  - while establishing the feasibility of way cheaper methods you should probably use first. [arxiv, journal]
  - used for ...


### Master's
---------------
* My **MSc** research developed numerical algorithms aware of the dynamical structure in the equations governing satellite orbits, in order to provide more accurate simulation of trajectories from:
    
  - an astrodynamics angle: Numerically-conservative integration in N-body problems [TU repo]
  - an applied math angle: Approximations to 1st Integrals in N-body problems [TU repo]
  - code [github]
