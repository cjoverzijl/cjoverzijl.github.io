* #### An Investment Game (2017)
  > Derived from a real event run for charity during the 2014 World Cup on the basis of the models introduced here, this presents a novel investment game, taking a quantitative finance approach to football tournaments. Published in [Wilmott](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wilm.10629), [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3273905).
  Matlab models.

    
* #### Ebola Outbreak Spread Models (2016)
  > Derived from work at a summerschool at the Santa Fe Institute, developed models describing the essential dynamics of the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. We focused on understanding the qualitative dynamics of SIR-class models, and how deviations correlated spatially and temporally with observed real-world features like border closures, geospatial migration networks, and genetic variation. Published in [NatureSciRep](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep34598), [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2840950).
  Python development combining mathematical SIR models with NetworkX and geomapping.


* #### Convergence in the Sciences (2015)
  > Based out of the Santa Fe Institute, developed an analysis of temporal trends in research, and distance-measures to quantify distance between clusters of research topics using only primary texts and LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) based topic modeling. Published in [Pensamiento](http://revistas.upcomillas.es/index.php/pensamiento/article/view/6590), and in preparation for publication we put a preprint with some of the work here in the CSSS15 [proceedings](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/resources/2015-csss-proceedings).
  Python/Matlab development, building on Mallet & NLTK.
