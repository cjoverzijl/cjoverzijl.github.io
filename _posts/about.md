## Applied Projects


#### Finance Ideas


* Designed a risk-monitoring approach using floating risk-bandwidths linked to the market, providing a more dynamic picture of where any particular clientâ€™s portfolio stands in the current market regime; [preprint](http://arxiv.org) available.

* Developed the models for, and major parts of a full \{ transaction-processing, analytics and reporting \} stack for an "Investment Game" organized for charity, running parallel to the 2014 World Cup, **live**, as a complete and investable securities market; [preprint](http://arxiv.org) describing the modeling available.


#### Complex Systems Approaches

* Combining information theory with model-risk techniques to find and fix flaws in standard modeling approaches to Ebola, in ways which make high-risk areas and intervention failures and success stories stand out on the map. In preparation for publication, [working paper](http://santafe.edu) available.

* Combining techniques from probabilistic topic modeling (using LDA) with clustering and visualization techniques to track the dynamics of research (or other) communities. In preparation for publication, [working paper](http://santafe.edu) available.



#### Other Quant Work

<!--General quantitative modeling and technology work:

* **Quantitative modeling**: developing Monte Carlo models for capital-protection and yield-enhancement structured-products (derivatives) and baskets, studying mutual-fund performance for client-investment strategy, visualizing factor-contributions to performance & risk analysis for live portfolios, and model development for integrated product-risk combining market, credit and liquidity models.

* **Technology development**: running small teams, developed two end-to-end platforms for performance & risk analytics (from sourcing and data-warehousing through modeling and visually-appealing automated reporting), and a business-intelligence platform for investment products & portfolios.




#### In Past Lives

* Developed a scalable, high-performance, quantum-chemical NEGF transport code, which was later integrated into a commercial quantum-chemistry modeling solution ([SCM's ADF/Band package](http://www.scm.com)).

* Designed a statistical approach to validation of GSM-R networks during field-trials on the high-speed railway networks in the Netherlands and Belgium, also used in the design of a network in Tunisia ([consulting for ClearCinCom](http://www.clearcincom.com)).
